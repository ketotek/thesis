In large server virtualization deployments the management of the network infrastructure
becomes harder to implement. The nodes and the entire network are getting very dynamic
so maintaining the entire network state and device configurations is difficult. One
solution to these problems is Software Defined Networking(SDN). SDN uses the OpenFlow
protocol to separate the data plane from the control plane. This approach allows the creation
of centralized controller applications, but it also introduces several issues.
One of them is the possibility to have inconsistencies between controllers and switches,
because of this new separation. Our project brings some OpenFlow features to the
Open vSwitch virtual software switch to mitigate these problems.
