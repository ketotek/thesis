In large server virtualization deployments the management of the network infrastructure
becomes harder to implement. The nodes and the entire network are getting very dynamic
so maintaining the entire network state and device configurations is difficult. One
solution to these problems is Open vSwitch, a virtual software switch. This paper
presents some contributions done for this open source project related to OpenFlow
support.
