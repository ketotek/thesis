Open vSwitch is an open source implementation of an OpenFlow software switch. While it is under active development,
support for OpenFlow is not complete. In this project we designed a couple of solutions that allow a better
synchronization between the state of the switch and the view the controller has about it. Firstly, we implemented
the possibility for a switch to notify a controller when it changes its permissions over the connection. Secondly,
we added the possibility to batch together multiple OpenFlow messages by implementing the bundles interface
from the OpenFlow specification.

The support for notifying controllers when a switch changes their role was done using OpenFlow \texttt{ROLE_STATUS}
asynchronous messages. Units tests were added to ensure that as few as possible regression will be possible.
These results were also sent for review to the open source development community and are now included in the
upstream version of Open vSwitch. There is work underway to update the asynchronous messages configuration to
OpenFlow 1.4. This will allow controllers to enable or disable the notifications for asynchronous messages
from switches, including \texttt{ROLE_STATUS} notifications.

There is now basic handling of OpenFlow 1.4 bundles messages in Open vSwitch. Our solutions allows a controller
to batch together port and flow modification messages and send them to execution to Open vSwitch.
